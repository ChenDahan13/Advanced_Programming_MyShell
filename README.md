## Overview
This task implements a simple Unix shell in C. The shell supports basic command execution, variable handling, command history, redirection and piping. Key features include custom commands such as echo, cd, quit and read, as well as signal handling for SIGINT (Ctrl+C). Additionally, the shell allows conditional execution with if-then-else statements and supports changing the shell prompt dynamically. This implementation demonstrates fundamental concepts of Unix systems programming, including process control, inter-process communication, and signal handling.
